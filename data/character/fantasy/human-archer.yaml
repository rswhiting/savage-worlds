Backstory: |
  Hutchins had a childhood dream. He wanted to be a Hero.

  Unfortunately, as Hutchins learned quickly enough, Heroes get hurt. They get cut. They bleed. They die. And as quickly as he'd begun training with a blade, he gave it up. No Sir, the Heroes life was not the right choice after all. Better to stand far... FAR... away from a fight and launch an arrow or three. If the fighting gets too close, well, thats what running away is for. Indeed, Hutchins found himself to be proficient at both shooting AND fleeing. Coupled with a nose for scenting out danger, Hutchins was far from heroic material. Hutchins is a natural born coward.

  Now, please don't think that makes Hutchins a bad person. He's affable enough and his cowardice doesn't usually affect others too badly. See, Hutchins is a man with ideas. Thats right, ideas. He figures he can still manage to find a Hero's payoff without all the Hero's risk. Its just a matter of finding the angle, right? And the key to that angle seems to be hiding among more sturdy folk, letting the folk who want to fight – who get off on fighting – do what they do best. See, no problems there. Hutchins will just hang back, take a shot when the opportunity presents itself, and let the cash roll in. If things get hairy, well, he'll do what he does best and run his buns off.

  Hutchins is an Archer for hire, and tends to take jobs where there are lots of wide open spaces. No dungeon delving for Hutchins, no Sir. Keep to the wide open spaces, thats his motto. More space to shoot. More space to run away. Space is good. Goooooood.
