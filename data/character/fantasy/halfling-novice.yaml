Description: Beta is your typical halfling. She has many different talents, but also seems to be loved by fate. Normally she is pretty slim, even for her size, but after a proper meal - she eats at least as much as dwarf - her belly pops out enormously. She extremely curious and cannot keep her mouth shut.
